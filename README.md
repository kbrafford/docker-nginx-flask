# docker-nginx-flask
Example Docker composition with nginx + flask

This example was taken from [Luis Ferrer-Labarca's Medium article](https://medium.com/bitcraft/docker-composing-a-python-3-flask-app-line-by-line-93b721105777)

The only difference is I made the python be based off of the Python 2 image instead of Python 3.  Everything else is exactly the same.

Will expand soon...
